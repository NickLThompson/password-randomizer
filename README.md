## Description

This is a website that will generate a password for you

based on the criteria that you want to include in your 

password. You choose a length between 8-128 characters

and have the option of including/excluding uppercase and

lowercase characters, numbers, and symbols. The randomly

generated password shows up in an alert prompt on the screen.

## Usage

The usage of this is to generate a completely randomized 

password for usage anywhere. It almost guarentees that 

the password will not be figured out because it will be

completely random, even if you only choose one of the 4

available options.

## Status

The status of this project is a success. I worked on this for 

multiple hours for multiple different days and the outcome was

exactly what I wanted. It was tough but I'm glad that I was able

to overcome it and learn from it.
